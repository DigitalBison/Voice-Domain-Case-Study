# AI & The Voice Domain: Real Time Voice Over (RTVO) and Voice Cloning

This AI Case Study focuses on the role of AI in Voice Domain, with a special emphasis on VoiceMod.  VoiceMod is the industry leader in Real Time Voice Over (RTVO) technology.  This technology changes the user's voice in real time, producing live modified output in digital communications.

## Input/Output mapping of RTVO Software

In terms of technical mapping the I/O microphone channel, RTVO very straightforward. 
1.  The RTVO software receives microphone input from the user's microphone.
2.  The software creates an artificial microphone input channel in the user's CPU settings.
3.  The user selects this software's' input channel in their communication app of choice (Discord, Zoom, etc), telling the communication app to use this channel for input.
4.  In the software, the user selects the RTVO voice they desire to use.
5.  The software outputs the artificial RTVO audio to the artificial microphone input channel.
6.  This artificial micrphone input channel then transmits the modified voice of the user to the communication app.

## VoiceMod and RTVO

![VoiceMod Logo](https://www.voicemod.net/v6/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Voicemod-logo.jpg)

VoiceMod is an AI powered real time voice modification app.  It works in conjunction with all major video conferencing apps (Zoom, Google Meets, MS Teams), all major gaming community apps (Discord, Roll20, TeamSpeak), multiple industy leading games (Minecraft, CounterStrike), has special hardware compatability with leading hardware peripheral manufactuers (CORSAIR, MSI), and a special extension for Twitch. 

VoiceMod also provides a wide variety of soundboard and special effects options, including exclusive Entertainment IP soundboard & RTVO packages.  These range widely from Rick and Morty to Wu-Tang Clan.

VoiceMod was founded in 2014, in Spain, by 3 brothers.  They had previously been musicians, and had previously also previously founded a small B2B startup dealing with similar voice technologies.

Voicemod's principle product is Voicemod for Desktop.  Numerous 2023 news articles cited 40 million + downloads.  In February 2023 they report 3.3 million active monthly users [(TechCrunch)]( https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/24/voicemod/ ) in cojunction with closing a venture capital round.  

VoiceMod's principle audience is Gamers, Streamers, and Content Creators.  VoiceMod offers over 100 voices, customization ability for those voices, tools to create unique voices, vast soundboard options, and a content creator store.  Official data from VoiceMod (2022) indicates 80%+ of users use VoiceMod "to create entertaining moments with my friends and other people online."  30%+ use it for RPG characters, 15%+ use it "to create a new persona for Vtubing or streaming, less than 15% specifically do so to hide their identity to avoid being recognized" (the way this is written indicates the [(VoiceMod Press Release)]( https://www.voicemod.com/latest-press-releases/for-fun-not-phishing-is-why-most-users-change-their-voice-identity-online )

VoiceMod's value proposition to users began with uses for games (especialy TableTop RPG games), music, fun silliness, and content creation.  As the company has grown it has found stable markets in these arenas, and it has further employed messaging towards users interested in privacy and digital communications (Zoom, etc).   VoiceMod's official communications repeatedly use the term "Sonic Identity".

Voicemod has kept up a steady pace of multi-year innovation.  In 2021 it released an SDK, MetaVerse direct compatability, CORSAIR hardware compatability, and a MacOS.  In 2022 it engaged in multiple Entertainment IP deals, including with AngryBirds, the Wu-Tang Clan, as well as software plugin capacity with all Tencent Cloud games, and continued hardware collaborations.  This expansion continued in 2023 with a Warner Brother's partnership featuring Rick and Morty sound content, additional hardware connectivity partnerships, and the launch of VMgram, a mobile version of VoiceMod's software. [(VoiceMod Press Release Hompeage)]( https://www.voicemod.com/latest-press-releases )

In 2023 Voicemod made its first (and thus far only) acquisition.  VoiceMod acquired Voctro Labs, a small AI company focused on music, singing, and voice synthesizing.

Starting in Summer 2022, announcements began featuring the term AI. First it announced a new line of voices and "World's First Real-Time AI-Powered Voice Conversion", allowing for greater speed, accuracy, sophistication.  [(VoiceMod Press Release)]( https://www.voicemod.com/latest-press-releases/voicemod-launches-worlds-first-real-time-ai-powered-voice-conversion-for-everyone ).  In 2023, VoiceMod further launched its AI Humans line of voices, presented as near totally realistic. Later in the year announced AI powered voice creation tools, including limited Voice Cloning features.

ZoomInfo reports VoiceMod having 150+ employees and having revenue of $31.5 million.  A general review of twitter and reddit, via google search, shows that their business model has generally remained the same.  Offering an annual subscription or a lifetime subscription.  The price of both has gradually gone up over time.  It's principle business metrics are total downloads, monthly active users, and then subscribers.  It utilizes powerful IP and tech partnerships to drive user adoption.' [(ZoomInfo)]( https://www.zoominfo.com/c/voicemod-sl/368854826 )

## AI Trends in the Voice Domain

The voice domain for AI has a robust competitive presence.  This is in 2 basic categories:
1. Real Time Voice Over (RTVO).
2. "Voice Cloning"- Voice generation, narration, and text to speech- but not in real time.

### RTVO

In the RTVO category, VoiceMod is the 1st mover and market leader.  A multitude of competitors have launched in the last year.  Among the notable competitors are:
1. MorphVox- A 20+ year old company (ScreamingBee) previously specialized in Voice Cloning. In 2021, ScreamBee launched a new version of their MorphVox software (MrphVox 5) which contains RTVO functionality. [(MorphVox)]( https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-voice-changer )
2. Voice.AI- Released in Beta in 2023.  A RTVO service requiring the use of paid credits.  Contains in-app incentives for users to share training data in exchange for  free credits. It also provides an option to earn credits by having your local CPU/GPU process training data (providing "computer" in exchange for credits). Offers a variety of paid plans to obtain credits.  In addition to RTVO, Voice.AI provides basic voice cloning features, and has a wide variety of celebrity and custom voices available for RTVO. [(Voice.Ai)]( https://voice.ai/ )

Numerous others have appeared in the last 12 months.  Interestingly, several of their websites mention RTVO to remove accents from call center employees.

### Voice Cloning

![Voice Cloning Process Map](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*iFHZCnmi_BWqGpLKBQNvsA.png)

In the Voice Cloning category:
1.  ElevenLabs- This is a clear market leader, and is worthy of a case study in its own right.  Founded by 2 AI/ML veterans in 2022, it has rapidly iterated to a $1 billion+ valuation with their latest funding round led by Andreessen Horrowitz and joined by Sequoia Capital.  ElvenLabs has eschewed RTVO and focused on natural sounding voice cloning, having made substantial breakthroughs on subtle vocal cues, pacing, tonation, emotional depth, accents, etc.  The principle application is text-to-speech and speech-to-speech functionality, and the speech can then be used for a multitude of other purposes (audiobooks, videos, TV show dubbing, commercials).  They have also made breakthroughs in multiple languages and language translation.  They have reached a point of being able to create a convincing voice clone from a 20 second sample. ElevenLabs also has generative voice AI capability, and full API compatability with ChatGPT.  They have already entered into a multitude of commercial agreements with major companies.  They have 52k twitter followers. [(ElevenLabs)]( https://elevenlabs.io/ ) [(Bloomberg)]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-22/ai-voice-cloning-startup-elevenlabs-valued-at-1-1-billion )
2.  Play.ht-  offers a substantially wider variety off off-the-shelf voices available to users (800+), and similar voice cloning features.  Play.ht started in 2016 offering a Chrome extension for text-to-speech, and in 2023 received Y Combinator funding.  It also has full API compatability with ChatGPT.  Their focus and business model is more consumer oriented. [(https://play.ht/)](https://play.ht/) [(Trackxn)]( https://tracxn.com/d/companies/play.ht/__R8AMz-eJzMjD8ajmEaka428bYI0JToq--xPmU0uvch4/funding-and-investors )
3.  Speechify - May be the most widely adopted Voice Cloner, with over 20 million downloads and 250,000 combined reviews across app market places.  Speechify has a special emphasis on the mobile space.  In addition to the core functionalities of ElvenLabs and Play.ht, Speechify's app has built in generative avatar creation and video creation features.  This allows users to create a video with a custom generative avatar, which uses text-to-speech with a cloned voice, ready for upload to popular social platforms (TikTok, Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, etc) etc in under 1 minute.

### Comparison of RTVO and Voice Cloning

In general, it appears that RTVO is less capable than Voice Cloning at capturing and conveying the details of tone, pitch, and other subtle vocal cues, in exchange for real time operation.  Whereas Voice Cloning technology is able, with AI help, to very accuratly capture those subtle cues (when working from a recording), and also very accuratly generate those cues when conducting text-to-speech.

In both RTVO and Voice Cloning, recent AI breakthroughs seem to have played a pivitol role in domain development.  This is particularly evident in the ability to rapidly generate new cloned voices, and make them available to consumer.


## Landmark and Trend Setting News Stories for the AI Voice Domain

1. Play.ht clones Joe Rogan & Steve Jobs and produces an AI-powered interview- Oct 2022.  This article also made global headlines.  What occured here is straightforward, cloned voices from play.ht were used (on an AI powered podcast no less!) to create an interview between Rogan and Jobs.  This is notable because Jobs has been dead since 2011  [(NewsWeek)]( https://www.newsweek.com/fake-joe-rogan-steve-jobs-ai-powered-interview-freaks-out-internet-1751275 )

2. Deepfake Phone Ransom Scan- April 2023- In this story, a teenager's voice was cloned, and used as part of a phone call to her mother to exort ransom money.  The voice was seemingly cloned and a recording of certain phrases (and screaming) was created, then played by the ransom caller.  The ransom caller would then state his own phrases.  It is likely that one of the above programs was used. [(CNN)]( https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/29/us/ai-scam-calls-kidnapping-cec/index.html )

3. David Aettenborough's voice is cloned by AI and is available in the wild- Nov 2023. One week later- David Aettenborough's voice is combined with ChatGPT Vision and the code is released on GitHub, for real time Aettenborough narration.  This story also made global headlines.  A multitude of youtubers subsequently posted videos of Aettenborough narrating them, their cats, their trips to taco bell.  Some of these operate in real time with the ChatGPT Vision connection and a several second delay, i.e., taking a picture every 5 secodns and generating 5-7 seconds of text-to-voice content, so that a continious stream of voice plays. [(YouTube)]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTb-7Gn-63o ) [(YouTube)]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOEz5xRLaRA )

4. The doxxing of Beff Jezos (e/acc founder)- December 2023-  This widely reported event ostensibly was based on Beff Jezos' apperance in Spaces on twitter, where he engaged in real voice conversation.  The reporters claimed to have used recordings of these conversations, applied AI acoustic analysis, and matched this to videos of Beff Jezos' speaking under his real name.  Though this is in theory plausible, there has been substantial speculation that this is a case of Parallel Construction.  Meaning: Beff Jezos' identity was likely determined in some other way (like access to Twitter's verification system), and then a plausible cover story was created. Mr. Jezos has subsequently acknowledged this dox as being accurate [(Forbes)]( https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2023/12/01/who-is-basedbeffjezos-the-leader-of-effective-accelerationism-eacc/?sh=2fb353967a13 )

5. Deepfake Zoom Scammer gets $25 mil in Hong Kong- January 2024- This story made immediate global headlines.  In short, an employee was phished into joining a Zoom call, which he believed was a legitimate business call.  In this call, the CFO joined along with other employees, on both video and audio.  The live video and live audio were sufficiently close to his previous experience of these executives that it overcame his doubts, and he followed their instructions to wire $25 million to accounts.  This resulted in the money being stolen.  There is technology for real-time face cloning software commercially available.  It is likely that one of the above programs was used for the audio component.

## Recommendations

In reviewing the above, I recommend VoiceMod for RTVO personal use, and Play.ht for personal voice cloning use.  

1. VoiceMod - VoiceMod is cheap, highly effective, well supported, and interfaces with nearly every conceivable video call service and video game.  It has dedicated support for hardware (like microphones) from major hardware manufacturers in the gaming and podcasting space.  The company is profitable, funded, and continues to make new development.  It's user interface is accessible and straight forward.  And it's fun!
2.  Play.ht- Play.ht is more cost advantageous for personal use, and has a wider variety of ready-to-go options, features, and voice clones.  Both have ChatGPT-API and general API interface options.  In terms of characters per month, Play.ht is 1/2 to 1/3 as expensive as ElevenLabs, depending on the price tier.  It is excellent for personal & amateur voice needs such as indie video games, indie audiobooks, and indie art creation.  For specific corporate needs related to expensive marketing, celebrities collaborations, professional voice actors etc, ElevenLabs is a better choice (and more expensive). [(Play.Ht Pricing)]( https://play.ht/pricing/) [(ElevenLabs Pricing)](https://elevenlabs.io/pricing)

No companies in this space are publically traded.  If they were, I would invest in VoiceMod (for the reasons listed above, especially it's strong moat) and ElevenLabs.  ElevenLabs has secured substantial client relationships with 41% of the Fortune 500, has a team of world level engineers, and has received direct investment from the world's leading venture capital firms.  It is likely to be an essential component for all manner of professional audio and voice domain business needs for the forseeable future.

## Conclusions

Reviewing leading companies and associated news, we see a synopsis of trends and landmarks in this domain.

Pre-AI, the field of RTVO and Voice Cloning made gradual incremental gains.  Both sides of the field had achieved basic functionality.  With the advent AI algorithims, both sides experienced rapid and immediate exponential gain, and a rapid series of breakthrough technologies.  This resulted, in the instance of ElevenLabs, of a new market entrant rapidly achieving $1 billion+ in valuation and displacing long established competitors.  In the example of VoiceMod, it allowed an established and growing company to rapidly expand its offerings, find new monetization channels, and secure its market leading position against competitors.
